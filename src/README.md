# Supplementary Material

This directory contains the supplementary material for the paper
*Intrinsic Types, a Logical Relation, and the Scourge of the Transfer Lemma*
submitted to tyde'24.

The material consists of a formalization of Stratified System F in the
proof assistant Agda.

## Dependencies

The code requires:

- the Agda proof assistant (version 2.6.4)

- the Agda Standard Library (version 2.0)

Due to recent changes in both Agda and the standard library, earlier
versions are *not* supported.

While Agda can be run from the commandline, we recommend using it with
the emacs mode or the vscode plugin. More information can be found on:
https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.3.20230914/getting-started/installation.html
